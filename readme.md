<!-- ## Development

Pushing to master is restricted. Please work in a `feature/` or `bug/` branch and create a pull request. Merging requires the CI passing, an approved review and the branch being up to date. -->

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production
$ npm run build
```

### Code Style

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format code. Prettier should be run before creating a pull request. You can run it with the default settings from your editor. For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://prettier.io).

## Frameworks

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Vuepress docs](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).
